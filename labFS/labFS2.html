<h3>
Assignment Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>
To learn about key file system concepts: logging, metadata, and directories</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Overview of Project</h3>

<blockquote>You will construct a user-level library that presents the
  abstraction of a reliable file system called RFS. In order to manage the complexity, you
  will implement this system in 4 phases, each of which presents a successively
  higher-level abstraction. You will be given the abstraction of a raw disk
  interface. In project ADisk, you constructed an atomic disk. On top of this you will build
  <ol>
    <li>A reliable multi-level tree in which a collection of
      data blocks can be stored</li>
    <li>A reliable flat file system</li>
    <li>A reliable directory-based file system (RFS)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>
The Assignment</h3>

<blockquote>Make a copy of your code from project ADisk. You will begin with the
  Disk abstraction we provided and ADisk abstraction you constructed.

<blockquote>In this part of the project, you will create a persistent on-disk
  tree abstraction using your atomic disk abstraction. The disk will store up to  MAX_TREES trees, each of
  which is identified by a TNum. The leaves of each tree are data blocks, and
  the trees grow as you add more blocks. You will make use of the ADisk to
  ensure that you can issue a series of updates to a tree or trees and have them
  occur atomically. For example, you could {update the free list to indicate
  that two blocks have been consumed, add a data block to one tree, add a data
  block to another tree causing that tree to grow the number of internal nodes
  it has} as a single atomic operation.
  <p><b>Interface</b>: Your PTree (persistent tree) class should implement the
  following public methods:</p>
  <b>Tree(boolean doFormat)</b> <b>throws IOException</b> This function is the
      constructor. If doFormat == false, data stored in previous sessions must
      remain stored. If doFormat == true, the system should initialize the
      underlying disk to empty.
  <p><b>TransID beginTrans():</b> This function begins a new transaction and returns an identifying transaction ID.<p><b>void
  commitTrans(TransID xid) throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException</b> This function commits the specified transaction.&nbsp;<p><b>void
  abortTrans(TransID xid) throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException</b> This function aborts the specified transaction.&nbsp;
  <p><b>int createTree(TransID xid) throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException,
  ResourceException </b>This function creates a new
      tree and returns the TNum number (a unique identifier for the tree).&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal"><b>void

  </b>This
      function removes the tree specified by the tree&nbsp; number <i>tnum</i>.
      The tree is deleted and the corresponding resources are reclaimed.&nbsp;
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>int getMaxDataBlockId(TransID xid, int tnum)</b> <b>throws
      IOException, IllegalArgumentException </b>This function returns the
      maximum ID of any data block&nbsp; stored in the specified tree. Note that blocks in a tree are numbered
      starting from 0.&nbsp;
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>void readData(TransID xid, int tnum, int blockId,
      byte buffer[])&nbsp;</b> <b>throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException </b>This function reads
      PTree.BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES bytes

      into the buffer specified by <i>buffer</i>.&nbsp; If the specified block
      does not exist in the tree, the function should fill *buffer with '\0'

      data in the tree specified by tnum. If the specified block does not exist
      in the tree, the function should grow the tree to include the new block.
      Notice that this growth may require updating multiple data structures --
      the free list, the pointer to the tree root, internal tree nodes, and the
      data block itself -- and all of these updates must be done atomically
      within the transaction.&nbsp;</p>

      is an uninterpreted array of bytes that higher-level code may
      use to store state associated with a given tree.&nbsp;</p>

      <b>int getParam(int param)&nbsp;</b> <b>throws IOException,

  <p><b>Requirements on implementation internals</b>:&nbsp;</p>


    You are <b>required</b> to use the following basic on-disk data
      structures for the trees.

  <ul>
    <LI>A tree has three types of node: a TNode (the root of the
    tree), zero or more internal nodes, and data blocks (the leaves
    that actually store data). Each internal node and each data block has a size of
    TNode.BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES bytes.</LI>

    
    <li> The root of each tree is a
      TNode. A TNode contains space for up to PTree.TNODE_POINTERS
      pointers to blocks that may be internal nodes or data blocks
      (see below.) 
      Additionally, each TNode should also
      hold PTree.METADATA_SIZE bytes of uninterpreted per-tree state
      that can be used by higher levels of software. Also, you need to
      store a <I>treeHeight</I> value (see below) in each TNode. Finally, you may
      want to store other per-tree metadata that you define in a
      TNode.</li>


      <li>A tree's TNode includes a <I>treeHeight</I> value that
      specifies how many levels of nodes are in the tree. If a tree's
      treeHeight is 1, then the tree's TNODE_POINTERS point to data
      blocks. If a tree's treeHeight is 2, then the tree's
      TNODE_POINTERS point to internal nodes of the tree, and each
      internal node points to up to POINTERS_PER_INTERNAL_NODE data
      blocks. If a tree's treeHeight is 3, then there is a root, two
      levels of internal nodes, and leaves. Etc. A tree's current
      height is determined by the ID of the highest block written in
      the tree: if no block higher than TNODE_POINTERS has been
      written, the height is 1; otherwise, if no block higher than TNODE_POINTERS
      * POINTERS_PER_INTERNAL_NODE has been written, the tree hight is
      2; otherwise, if no block higher than TNODE_POINTERS
      * POINTERS_PER_INTERNAL_NODE^2 has been written, the tree hight is
      2; etc.
      The maximum 
      height of a tree is determined by the maximum allowed block ID
      TNode.MAX_BLOCK_ID.</LI>

      <li>Your implementation <b>must</b> support &quot;holes&quot; in tree
      data and sparse trees: (1) An internal node should only be allocated if there
      is at least one leaf that is that node's descendent and that has
      been written. (2) A tree's height should be the minimum height
      needed to accomodate all non-empty leaves.
      E.g., if I seek to a random offset in the tree and write a block,
      the system should create the necessary internal nodes to reach the newly
      written block, but it should not populate other data blocks or
      internal nodes. Thus, notice that TNODE_POINTERS and pointers in
      internal nodes can be NULL.</li>

      <LI>Notice that there is a read from a block ID that has never been
      written, your implementation should return a zero-filled block
      rather than throwing an exception. Your implementation must not
      allocate new internal nodes (or leaf blocks) in this case, however.

      <LI>Thus, the treeHeight of a tree must change dynamically as
      new blocks are written. For example, if all writes to a
      tree are to block IDs less than TNODE_POINTERS, then the tree's
      height is 1. Then, if a write to block (TNODE_POINTERS + 1)
      occurs, you will need to (1) increase the treeHeight to 2, (2)
      allocate an internal node, (3) copy the existing TNODE_Pointers
      from the TNode to the new internal node, (4) add a new block
      pointer in the internal node, (5) clear the existing
      TNODE_POINTERS from the internal node, (6) initialize the
      TNode's first pointer to point to the new internal node. Aren't
      you glad you have transactions?</LI>

    <li> Your readData and writeData must read into memory the TNode
      and the 
      InternalNodes between the root and the leaf in question and no others. It
      is not acceptable, for example, to always read an entire tree into memory
      before operating on any part of it.</li>

   <li>You should store an array of PTree.MAX_TREES TNodes (tree
      roots) across a fixed set
      of disk sectors. Thus, given a tree number tNum, you should be able to
      locate the place on disk where the corresponding TNode structure is
      stored.<!--- &nbsp; A
      TNode should be smaller than a 
      sector, so you <b>must</b> store multiple TNodes in the same disk
      sector. </li>  --->

      

      <LI>You may not "preload" your forest of trees into memory. Nor
      may you store the full array of TNodes in memory.  Doing so is
      feasible for our 8MB file system, but would not be reasonable if
      our disk were large. Instead, you should just read pieces of
      trees as you need them for the current transactions. You are not
      required to implement a cache of recently read
      sectors---simplicity trumps performance for this project. You
      may store a copy of the free block bitmap in memory if you
      like, but this is not a requirement.</LI>

      <li>In addition, you are <b>required</b> to implement a free
      block list, and this free block list must be stored as an 
      on-disk bitmap.</li>

      <LI>In addition to your TNode array and free block bitmap, you
      may want to store other per-file-system data in a sector or
      block of disk that you reserve for that purpose.</LI>


  </ul>

    TNode.BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES bytes.</LI>

    
    <li> The root of each tree is a
      TNode. A TNode contains space for up to PTree.TNODE_DIRECT
      pointers to data blocks, one pointer to an indirect block (an
      internal node containing POINTERS_PER_INTERNAL_NODE pointers to data blocks),
      and one pointer to a double indirect block (containing POINTERS_PER_INTERNAL_NODE
      pointers to indirect blocks.)

  <p><b>Simplifying assumption</b>:
  <UL>

  <LI>Although the ADisk you built supports multiple concurrent
  transactions, to simplify the design you are not required to support multiple concurrent transactions at the PTree layer or above.  You
  must, however, still be thread safe by ensuring that multiple
  threads from the same transaction are coordinated. In particular,
  you may (1) use a single lock to coordinate access through all
  public methods, (2) have beginTrans() block if there is already
  an outstanding transaction, and (3) have abortTransaction() and
  commitTransaction() signal a thread waiting in beginTransaction() (if
  any).</LI>

  </UL>

  <p><b>Hints</b>: You are not required to follow this advice, but I think it
  might help. Feel free to ignore it if you have a better way.&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You should select four ranges of blocks on the disk for four key data
      structures: file system global parameters (e.g., the number of free
      sectors or tree roots), the array of tree root pointers, the free sector
      list, and the remaining sectors.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>In your TNode implementation, you may find it convenient to store
      additional information about the tree in the TNode. You are welcome to do
      so.</li>
    <li> You may want to use Java Object Serialization to move objects
       between memory and disk.</LI>
   <li>Begin this part of the project by writing down your main data
      structures, and then writing pseudo-code for each of the above functions
      in terms of methods on these data structures.</li>
    <li>Test as you go. Build a subset of the above functionality and test it
      thoroughly, rather than trying to test all of these functions at once. Test not only the external interfaces, but also invariants you know about the internal structure. For example, you could write a test that walks the
      InternalNodes of a specified tree to test some invariant that you know
      must hold. For example, you could write a test that walks all trees to make sure that the blocks allocated to the trees are all marked as used on the free map.</li>

<p><b>Hints</b>: This layer adds very little to the persistent tree layer.
  Primarily, instead of reading and writing blocks, now you read and write
  ranges of bytes. So, read and write will need to translate requests for
  ranges of bytes into a series of requests for blocks. Also, notice that if
  offset &lt; file length and offset + count &gt;= file length, the read
  function should only read to the end of the file and not beyond it (returning
  a value smaller than count). So, you will need to
  store the file length in bytes with each tree.</p>

<p>File systems would be less useful if you needed to remember the inumber of each
file you create. File systems therefore use a higher-level API with
hierarchical file names to make it easy to organize and remember where data are
stored.</p>
<p>A directory is treated in RFS like any other file, except that it
can not be written to directly by user programs. The directory file consists
of several entries, each describing a file or a directory. Each directory must
contain at least two entries. The first one refers to the parent directory, and
has the name &quot;..&quot;, like in UNIX. The root directory's parent is the
root directory itself, which is the only exception. The second mandatory entry
has the name &quot;.&quot; which points to the directory itself.</p>
<p>Updates to the directory structure occur only as a result of a file deletion
or creation. A directory entry contains a flag showing whether the entry is used
or not. You may want to include other status information in this flag according
to your design. The flag is followed by the index of the inode of the
file or directory corresponding to that entry. The last field in the entry is
the file or directory name, which is a fixed-length string.
Note that in practice, we would not want to use fixed-size arrays to store names as they
would cause
unacceptable inefficiency in disk access speed and space utilization, but we
allow this simplification for the project.</p>
<p>We provide a simple template for a directory entry class, <a href="DirEnt.java">DirEnt.java</a>.&nbsp;Note that this is an internal detail of your file system. You are welcome
to change it.</p>
<p>When you format the disk, you will need to create the root directory, whose
inode should always be at a known location. For example, in UNIX, the root
directory is typically stored as inode 0, 1, or 2.</p>
<p>RFS allows users to create hierarchically-named files e.g., &quot;/foo/bar/baz.&quot;
A file name used in any of these functions is a String. No component of the name between two
'/' characters or after the last '/' character can exceed FS_MAX_NAME characters
in length.</p>
<p>Although file names are convenient for users, requiring string manipulation
on each system call would increase the overhead of file access. Thus, the API
allows users to <i>open</i> files using their names and then to read and write
open files using <i>file descriptors. </i>A file descriptor is an integer
between 0 and FS_MAX_FD that you will use as an index to an open-file-descriptor
table that you will maintain. User programs use file descriptors to identify
files in file system calls instead of repeatedly using file or directory names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that each operation that operates on a directory must execute atomically: either
the entire operation completes or the file system is left in the state it was in
before the request issued. Similarly, a set of operations that operate on an
open file must all operate as a single atomic unit. Notice that unlike the previous interfaces, these
interfaces do not take a transaction ID -- of these library calls
internally create and commit transactions as needed. You should begin/end transactions within your code for these calls. This arrangement is more
convenient for the user, but it has the disadvantage that a user cannot cause
several of these calls to be executed atomically.</p>
<p>
A description of each file system call follows:</p>
<p><b>RFS(boolean doFormat) throws IOException</b> This function is the
      constructor. If doFormat == false, data stored in previous sessions must
      remain stored. If doFormat == true, the system should initialize the
      underlying file system to empty.
<p><b>int createFile(String filename, boolean openIt) throws IOException,
IllegalArgumentException: </b>
This function atomically creates a new file with the name <i>filename.
Filename </i>is a full pathname (starting with
&quot;/&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp; If the parameter <I>openIt</i> is true, the function returns a file descriptor
of the open file corresponding to the newly created file; in this
case, the initial create(), a
sequence of zero or more read() and write() calls to that file, and a final close() should all occur
within a single transaction.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><b>void createDir(String dirname) throws IOException,
IllegalArgumentException </b>This function atomically creates a directory entry with the name <i>dirname</i>.
As before, the name is interpreted as a full pathname.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>void unlink(String name) throws IOException,
IllegalArgumentException </b>This function atomically removes the entry specified by the <i>name.</i>
The name is interpreted as usual. If the name corresponds to a file <i>and </i>the file is not
currently open, it is
deleted and the corresponding resources are reclaimed. If name corresponds to a directory, it is deleted only if it is
an empty directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>void rename(String oldName, String newName)</b> <b>throws IOException,
IllegalArgumentException</b> This function atomically
changes the name of an existing file <i>oldName</i> into a new file new<i>Name.&nbsp; </i> </p>
<p><b>int open(String name) throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException </b>
This function performs a lookup on the file or directory whose name is specified
by <i>name</i>. The character string specified
by <i>name</i> must start with &quot;/&quot;
making <i>name</i> a full pathname that starts
from the root of the file system. The call returns a file descriptor that can be
used later to refer to the file or directory specified by the search path. The
function fails if <i>name</i> does not specify
an existing file, if no file descriptors are free, or if the name corresponds to a
directory. All reads and writes to the open file are part of a single
transaction.</p>
<p><b>void close(int fd) throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException&nbsp; </b>This function closes the open file indicated by the file descriptor
fd and commits any updates. Subsequent access to files through the fd descriptor must return an
error, until the fd is reused again in an open call. Also, any resources used to
support the file descriptor should be reclaimed at this point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>int read(int fd, int offset,
int count, byte buffer[]) IOException, IllegalArgumentException&nbsp; </b>This function reads <i>count</i> bytes from
the file specified by <i>fd</i> into the
buffer specified by <i>buffer</i>. The
parameter <i>offset</i> specifies the starting
location within the file where the data should be read. Upon success, the
function returns the number of bytes read (this number can be less than <i>count</i>
if no more bytes are available from the position specified by <i>offset</i>
until the end of the file).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>void write(int fd, int offset,
int count, byte buffer[]) IOException, IllegalArgumentException&nbsp; </b>This function writes <i>count</i> bytes from
the buffer specified by <i>buffer</i> into the
file specified by<i> fd</i>. The parameter <i>offset</i>
specifies the starting location within the file where the data should be
written. Attempting to write beyond the end of file should extend the size of
the file to accommodate the new data. These writes will commit when the file is
closed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>String[] readDir(String dirname) IOException,
IllegalArgumentException </b>This function atomically reads the entries that exist in the directory specified by <i>dirname</i>.
and returns the result in an array of String objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>int size(int fd): IOException, IllegalArgumentException </b>This function returns the number of bytes contained in the open file identified
by <i>fd</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>int space(int fd): IOException, IllegalArgumentException
</b>
This function returns the number of data blocks (excluding internal nodes)
consumed by the open file identified
by <i>fd</i>.&nbsp; Notice that space has to consider the existence of holes
while size is not affected by holes in a file.</p>

<p>All of your implementations must adhere to (e.g., must not change) the public
interfaces specified above. You may not modify the Disk interface in any way.
You may add additional public methods to ADisk, PTree, or FlatFS, but
we don't think you will need to do so. Although the &quot;internal interfaces&quot; of
  parts 1 and 2 would not be accessible to a &quot;normal user&quot; of the file
  system you create in part 3, we will test those internal interfaces during
  grading.

<p>Electronically turn in (1) your well commented and elegant source code and
  (2) a file called README. Turn in the entire
body of source code needed for this project (e.g., turn in your ADisk
  again for project F-II and your flat file system again for F-III).
<p>Your README  file should include 5 sections:
<ul>
<li>
Section 1: Administrative: your name (and your partner's), the number of slip days that you have used
on this project and so far </li>

<li>
Section 2: A list of all source files in the directory with a 1-2 line
description of each</li>

<li>
Section 3: 3 (or 4) short paragraphs, each describing the high-level design of part 1
and part 2 (and part 3).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Section 4: A 1/2 page high-level description of&nbsp; how you ensure that all
actions by the PTree and FlatFS (and PFS) are made atomic. E.g., explain how you
structured your code so that even if the system crashes in the middle of any
operation, after recovery, all on-disk data structures are either in the state
it was before the operation or after the complete operation, but not in a
middle-stage</li>

<li>
Section 5: A discussion of your testing strategy. Outline the programs you used (at a
high level), what each one tests, and the results of those tests. (More detailed low-level comments should be in
the programs, themselves.)</li>

The project will be graded on the public <B>Linux</B>&nbsp;
cluster (run 'cshosts publinux' to get a list) Portability should not be a major issue if you develop on a different
platform. But, if you chose to develop on a different platform,
porting and testing on Linux by the deadline is your responsibility. The
statement &quot;it worked on my other machine&quot; will not be considered in
the grading process in any way.</li>

Code will be evaluated based on its correctness, clarity,
and elegance. Strive for simplicity. Think before you code.</li>
