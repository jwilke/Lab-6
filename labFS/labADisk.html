<h2>
CS439 Project ADisk - An Atomic Disk</h2>
<p>
<b>Due: </b>5:59:59 PM April 9 2012</p>
</center>
<HR>

<h3>
Assignment Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>
To learn about key storage system concepts: logging and transactions</li>

<li>
To provide the basis for project FS, where you will build a reliable file system.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Overview of Project</h3>

<blockquote>In projects ADisk and FS, you will construct a user-level library that presents the
  abstraction of a reliable file system called RFS. In order to manage the complexity, you
  will implement this system in several phases, each of which presents a successively
  higher-level abstraction. You will be given the abstraction of a raw disk
  interface. On top of this you will build
  <ol>
    <li>An atomic disk</li>
    <li>A reliable multi-level tree</li>
    <li>A reliable flat file system</li>
    <li>A reliable directory-based file system (RFS)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This project, deals only with step 1 above. It is very important
  to do an excellent job on this part of the project, or you will have
  significant problems in the next part.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
The Assignment</h3>

<blockquote>Before you begin the assignment, grab the following
code: <a href="../lab-FS.tar">lab-FS.tar</a>
<p>This tar archive contains the source code to the raw disk interface as well
as files defining the other interfaces listed below. To extract the files from the archive, use the following command.
<blockquote><tt>tar -xvf lab-FS.tar</tt></blockquote>
  A directory called <b><tt>lab-FS/</tt></b> will be created,
and your files will be extracted into it.

<blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal">RFS will be implemented using an 8-Mbyte file with a
  &quot;device driver&quot; that treats this storage space as a contiguous array
  of raw disk sectors, each of size Disk.SECTOR_SIZE bytes. This driver is similar to
  Linux's block device interface. The disk sectors are numbered from 0 to Disk.<i>NUM_OF_SECTORS</i>- 1 inclusive.
  No partial read or write to a disk sector is
  possible. This important restriction has several implications on the design of
  the file system. For example, updating a single byte in a disk sector requires
  that the sector be read in memory, modified, and then written back to disk.
  Similarly, reading a single byte in a disk sector requires that the sector be
  read entirely from disk though only one byte is to be read.</p>

  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  <h2>Disk</h2>
  <p>A <a href="Disk.java">Disk</a> provides an asynchronous interface: requests
  are issued and later a callback provides the results of the action. When you
  create a Disk, you register an object that will receive
  callbacks:</p>


  <p>  public <b>Disk(DiskCallback callback)</b>  throws FileNotFoundException</p>
  <p>The callback is an object that will receive notifications when operations
  complete (see below). </p>

  
  <p>Once a Disk is created, the following method initiates a read or write
  request:</p>
  <p>public void <b>startRequest(int operation, int tag, int
  sectorNum, byte b[]) </b>    throws IllegalArgumentException,
  IOException</p>
  <UL>
  <p><I>operation</I> is Disk.READ or Disk.WRITE</p>
  <p><I>tag</I> is an identifier
  the caller may user to match replies with requests. Disk does not
  interpret tag, it just passes it through with the request so that
  the callback corresponding to the request has the same tag. Note
  that the value DiskResult.RESERVED_TAG is reserved for error
  signaling. </p>
  <p><I>sectorNum</I> identifies the sector to access</p>
  <p><I>b[]</I> is a byte array from which to write or into which to
  read (depending on the operation).</p>
    </UL>
  <p><i>Warning</i>: You must not re-use b[] until the operation is complete.</p>
  <p><i>Warning</i>: You are not guaranteed that reads or  writes will complete in the
  order they are issued. In fact, the thread inside of Disk will process pending
  requests in a random-ish order.</p>

    <p> You can constrain the order of operations to disk by inserting
    barriers with the following call:</p>
    
    <p> public <b>void addBarrier()</b> throws IOException</p>

    <p>All reads and writes issued before a barrier will be completed before any
  reads or writes issued after the barrier. </p>

    <p>Note that although you could put a barrier before/after each
    read and write, for good performance in practice (and full credit for the
    lab), you should use barriers judiciously. Whenever you use a
    barrer, your code should include a comment explaining exactly why
    you need one. Be brief and precise; if the reader cannot easily figure
    out what your comment means, it is not useful.</p>
    

    <p>For testing/debugging, you can also arrange for your disk to crash with
  some probability at some point in the future.</p>

    <p>public <b>setFailProb()</b> <I>See source file for
    details.</I></p>
    
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>DiskCallback, DiskResult, and DiskUnit</h2>
  <p>A <a href="DiskCallback.java">DiskCallback</a> defines an interface that
  must be implemented by an object that receives completion notices in the form
  of a <a href="DiskResult.java">DiskResult</a> when a read or write request finishes.</p>
  <p>public void <b> requestDone(DiskResult result)</b></p>
  <p>So, when the operation you started with Disk::startRequest() completes,
  DiskCallback::requestDone() will be called. <a href="DiskUnit.java">DiskUnit</a>
  gives some examples of how this works.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
  <p>Your task is to design, implement, and thoroughly test an <i>atomic disk.</i>
  The atomic disk allows a series of writes to different sectors to be made and
  then atomically applied -- either all the writes occur or none of them do. The
  atomic disk presents a similar interface to the disk, except (a) each read and
  write includes a transaction ID and (b) there are additional calls to begin,
  commit, abort, and apply transactions. You will implement this atomicity by
  providing an <b>redo log</b> on disk This redo log will consume
  ADisk.REDO_LOG_SECTORS
  sectors of your disk, so users of the ADisk will see a smaller disk
  (n o larger than Disk.NUM_OF_SECTORS -
  ADisk.REDO_LOG_SECTORS sectors; possibly a few sectors smaller than
that if you reserve sectors for other disk metadata such as a
  start-of-log pointer.).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In particular, an <a HREF="ADisk.java">ADisk</a> implements the
  following interface:</p>
  <p>  // Allocate an ADisk that stores its data using<br>
  // a Disk.<br>
  //<br>
  // If format is true, wipe the current disk<br>
  // and initialize data structures for an empty&nbsp;<br>

  // Otherwise, initialize internal state, read the log,&nbsp;<br>
  // redo any committed transactions<br>
  public <b> ADisk(boolean format)</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  // Return the total number of data sectors that<br>
  // can be used *not including space reseved for<br>

 public <b>void writeSector(TransID tid, int sectorNum, byte buffer[])</b>&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IllegalArgumentException,    IndexOutOfBoundsException</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  // Read the disk sector numbered sectorNum and place<br>
  // the result in buffer. Note: the result of a read of a<br>
  // sector must reflect the results of all previously<br>
  // committed writes as well as any uncommitted writes<br>
  // from the transaction tid. The read must not<br>
  // reflect any writes from other active transactions<br>
  // or writes from aborted transactions.<br>
  void <b> readSector(TransID tid, int sectorNum, byte buffer[])&nbsp;<br>
  </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException,    IndexOutOfBoundsException</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> // Write all of the transaction's updates to the log.<br>

  // Then, write "commit" to the log</br>
  // Then, wait until the "commit" is safely on disk.<br>
  // Ensure that eventually,<br>
  // the updates within the transaction are<br>
  // writen to their specified sectors, but don't wait for<br>
  // the writeback to finish before returning<br>
  // e.g., mark the transaction data structure as <br>
  // "committed" and move it to the writeback queue.<br>
  //<br>
  // Hint: Things will probably be easier if<br>
  // you make sure that commit i+1 cannot land<br>
  // on disk before commit i is on disk.<br>
  // Barriers may help here.<br>

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>



  <h2><b>Asynchronous IO</b></h2>
  <p>Writes to the log within a transaction must be asynchronous -- (1) write() must
  return without waiting for its write to go to disk. (2) When a transaction commits,
  you must send the writes to the log, issue a barrier request, and
  then send the commit record to the log.
  (3) Only after the commit (and all the writes in the transaction it
  commits, of course) is (are) safely in the log, can the commit() call
  return. (4) Only after the commit has completed, you should arrange
  for the updates to get written to their final locations on disk. (5)
  The commit() call should return before these write-backs (to the
  final locations on disk) complete; it <I>may</I> return before these
  write-backs are even issued (e.g., another thread may issue those writes.)</p>

 <p><I>Hint:</I> If two transactions update the same sector, you need
  to make sure that the write from the transaction that <I>commits
  later</I> happens <I>after</I> the write from the earlier-committed
  transaction.  A good way to do this might be to have a
  producer/consumer queue for committed transactions' writes. Then, commit()
  puts a set of writes into the queue, and a single write-back thread
  pulls a transaction's writes from the queue, asynchronously issues
  them all, waits for them all to complete, and then moves to do the
  write-back for the next transaction's writes.</p>


  <p><I>Hint: </I> The log will have a sequence of writes for a
  transaction followed by a commit record for that transaction (or no
  commit record if the system crashed before the commit made it to disk.) The
  problem is: How do you know if the sector you are reading is a
  "commit" or just a sector update that happens to look like a
  "commit"? You also need to know which sectors were updates by the
  transaction's writes. So, you probably want to preceed a transaction's writes in the
  log with a description of the transaction's writes: how many are
  there, what sector is updated by each write, etc. Thus, it may be
  useful if your log looks like: [transaction_metadata [sectors]* transaction_commit]*</p>



  <h2><b>Concurrency</b></h2>
  <p>Note that your implementation must use locks and
      condition variables to enforce concurrency control. </p>

  <p>One shared data structure you are likely to have will be an
  object to represent each in-progress transaction. Multiple threads may concurrently attempt to
  read/write/commit/abort the same transaction. Your code must
  synchronize such concurrent access. 

  <p>Multiple in-progress transactions may try to update the same
  sector. A read by transaction <i>T</i> of sector <i>S</i>
  must return the data from the latest write to sector <i>S </i>by transaction <i>T</i>,
  if any. If transaction <i>T</i> has not updated sector <i>S</i>, then a read
  must return the data written by last write of sector <i>S</i> by the
  last-committed
  transaction <i>T'</i> that wrote sector <i>S</i>.</p>

  <p><I>Hint:</I> If you have a per-transaction set of updates and a
  write-back queue of committed transactions' writes, then a read
  could first check it's transaction, then check the write-back queue,
  and then, if necessary, read from disk. When you read from the
  write-back queue, make sure you enforce the "last commit wins" rule.</p>

  <p><I>Hint:</I> It is logically possible to have two transactions
  committing "at the same time", so that, for example, both  t1 and t2
  issue their writes to the log at the same time (to different
  locations in the log, obviously). Then, t1 and t2 could both issue
  their commits. This "optimization" is not required. In fact, it is a
  probably a bad idea for at least two reasons. First, it will
  complicate recovery (after a crash transaction i in the log may not
  have a commit in the log, but transaction i+1 or i+7 may). Second, to the extent that the updates get
  performed in a way that takes advantage of this extra concurrency,
  performance would be worse not better (due to extra rotational
  delays between writing a transaction's data and its commit.) The point
  of this whole hint is: You probably want to ensure that only one
  thread/transaction is doing a commit at a time. Put a barrier in an
  appropriate place.


<h2><b>Recovery</b></h2>
<p>  When your system starts, you need to make sure that all updates in the log from
  committed 
  transactions (1) are immediately visible to reads and (2) are eventually written to their final locations on
  disk. So, your recovery code must read data from the logs, update in
memory data structures, update disk, or both. Make sure you follow the ordering rule above (if two
  transactions update the same sector, the update from the transaction
  that <I>committed last</I> is the one that must "win".)  Notice that
  transactions may not commit in the same order that they begin, so
  the <I>tid</I> you assign when a transaction starts cannot be used
  to order updates on recovery.</p>

  <p><I>Hint: </I>One option is to have special-purpose code that
  reads each transaction from the log, does that transaction's
  write-back, waits for the write-back to complete, and then goes on
  to the next committed transaction. But there may be a simpler way:
  you probably already have code that applies a list of transactions
  in a specified order. And that makes sure that reads "see" these
  writes while they are still pending. Can you re-use that code?</p>

 <H2><B>Circular log</B></H2>

<p>Your on-disk log is fixed size, and you should treat it as a
circular log with new updates added at the head and the tail pointing
to the oldest update from a committed transaction that has not been
(or may not have been)
written back to its final location on disk. So, every write to a transaction moves the head forward. 
And, when a write-back completes, the tail moves forward. Obviously,
you must make sure the head does not pass the tail.</p>

<p>If a transaction tries to commit when there is not room to send its
writes to the log, the commit call should block until the transaction's
updates and commit can be written to the log. (If a single transaction
has too many writes to fit in the log, even if the log were otherwise
empty, you should throw an exception either on the culprit write or on
the commit.)  </p>

<p>On recovery, ideally the recovery thread would read the log from
the tail to the head so that it can commit exactly the writes that
have not been written back yet. Note, however, that it is safe to
start <I>before</I> the tail -- it is no problem to re-write-back a
write that has already been written back (as long as ordering
constraints are followed.) So, you don't need to have a perfect
on-disk head or tail pointer. Still, it may simplify things if you
know about where the tail is. One option is to store a "log-start"
pointer in a well-known sector on disk. The log-start must always be
at or before the tail and the head may not cross the log-start. </p>

<p>As your career progresses, you will find that writing simple
sanity-check tests for each object you write will save you enormous
amounts of time and make you a much more productive programmer. So, we
should not have to require you to write any specific tests because you
should already be planning to do so. But, thorough testing of this
part of the project is so important to the rest of the project, that
we're going to require it.</p>

<p>Write a program called ADiskUnit that executes a series of unit
tests for ADisk. Designing such tests is a skill that deserves
practice, so we do not provide a full list of what you should
test. You might start with simple reads and writes within a
transaction. Then look at reads and writes across transactions that
commit or abort. Be sure to test garbage collection and crash recovery. You
should have some tests with a single thread and some with more.  
Should probably have some tests for the simple case when the
disk doesn't crash and some for the case where it does. Etc. We strongly
recommend writing the tests as you add each piece of functionality rather than
trying to write a bunch of tests as an afterthought once you have finished the
project.</p>

<p>The TA will also have a set of unit tests (other than yours) to use
for grading your code. So, passing your tests is not necessarily
enough. But, if you design good tests, then passing your tests makes
it much more likely that you will pass the TA's tests.</p>

<p>Additional comments</p>
<UL>
<LI>Your tests must be self-checking. That is, after each test, you
should output a simple statement like "Test Succeeds" or "Test Fails."
(e.g., you should not require a human to read through 100 lines of output to
see if the read on line 92 matches the write on line 7; instead, your
unit test program should remember the earlier write it did and compare
the read result to it.)<br>

Your ADisk should have the following internal structures and types:

<UL>
<LI>
An <A HREF="ActiveTransactionList.java">ActiveTransactionList</A>
keeps a list of <A HREF="Transaction.java">Transaction</A>s that have
been started but not yet committed or aborted.<br>

ADisk.beginTransaction() adds a transaction to this
list. ADisk.readSector() checks an active transaction to see if
the desired sector has been written within that
transaction. ADisk.writeSector() adds an update to an active
transaction. ADisk.commitTransaction() and ADisk.abortTransaction()
remove a transaction from the active transaction list.
</LI>

<LI>
A <A HREF="WriteBackList.java">WriteBackList</A> keeps a list of
transactions that have committed but that have not yet been written
back.<br>

ADisk.commitTransaction() should move a Transaction from the
ActiveTransactionList to the WriteBackList. (But note that it should
wait until the commit is in the log before putting the transaction on
this list.) <br>

Notice that all of the transactions on the write back list are
committed but not yet on disk. This means that ADisk.readSector()
needs to check this list to see if the sector being read has an update
here. It might even have multiple updates here, in which case the read
should return the last sector committed.<br>

A writeback thread should write the updates from the oldest
transaction on this list; then remove that transaction from this list;
then repeat.<br>

A simple way to do recovery  should be to take each committed
transaction you find in the log and put it on this list. Then
writeback can just happen in its normal way.</LI>


<LI>A <A HREF="Transaction.java">Transaction</A> keeps the status of a
transaction (INPROGRESS, COMMITTED, ABORTED), a list of writes for
the transaction, and other information about the transaction.<br>

ADisk.writeSector() adds a write to a transaction;
ADisk.readSector() checks to see if the desired sector has been
written within the transaction and, if so, returns the corresponding
value. ADisk.commit() commits a transaction and ADisk.abort() aborts a
transaction, which, among other things, means that any read or write
that has not completed and that tries to use this transaction will
return an error.<br>

A Transaction can be written to the
log. If a transaction is committed, Transaction.getSectorsForLog()
returns an array of sectors to be written to the log. This array
includes one or sector containing header data, stating which
Disk sectors this transaction updates, then some sectors of updates, then
a commit sector.<br>

During recovery, sectors from the log can be read to produce a
transaction. Transaction.parseHeader() takes an array of bytes
corresponding to a disk sector that contains a transaction header and
identifies how many sectors from the log to read to get the full transaction; then
Transaction.parseLogBytes() takes that many sectors of data and tries
to produce a committed Transaction (if the transaction from the log was not
committed, an exception is thrown instead).<br>

Don't forget to synchronize access to a Transaction in case multiple
threads are simultaneously working on the same transaction. So you'll
want locks. You'll also want to handle the case where a transaction
gets committed or aborted and then a read or write tries to make use
of it.</LI>

<LI>You'll need to keep track of what parts of the log are in use so
that you know where to write the next committed transaction and so that
you'll know when you need to wait for garbage collection before
writing the next committed transaction. During recovery, you'll need
to figure out where to start reading from. <A
HREF="LogStatus.java">LogStatus</A> will help coordinate access to the log.</LI>


<LI>You'll need to handle the asynchrony of the disk and have some way
to track when sets of pending requests get done. One way to do this is
to have a simple <A HREF="CallbackTracker.java">CallbackTracker</A>
object that stores results as they arrive, indexed by tag and that
lets a requestor wait until a particular tag has a result.</LI>

Break this project into a bunch of small, managable, testable
steps. Here is one sequence. At each step, write and run some unit
tests to make sure things are working as expected. Your README should
describe the steps you took and the unit tests at each step.

<UL>
  <LI>Full pseudocode. I've sketched some basic data structures and
  outlined how they work, but you should not start building until you
  have figured out how they will all fit together. <br>

  Go top down. For the ADisk, list its member variables. Then, for
  each public method of ADisk, write the pseudo-code for that public
  method in terms of operations on ADisk's member variables. <br>

  Now you know the interface each of these internal classes
  needs. Write down those public methods for each of these classes
  (it's OK to change them from what I provided, to add new arguments,
  or to add new methods.) Then, for each of these classes, write down
  its member variables and the pseudocode for its methods.<br>

  Make sure you understand how all the pieces will fit together
  <b>before</b> you start writing code.<br>

  At this stage, list the tests you will run  as unit tests for each
  of these classes.<br>
  
<LI>Single Transaction works: addWrite(), checkRead(), commit(), and
  abort() all do appropriate things to the data structure. Can iterate
  through updates of a committed transaction using
  getNUpdatedSectors() and getUpdateI(). Can get an
  array of bytes using getSectorForLog() and reconstitute an
  equivalent transaction using parseHeader() and parseLogBytes() on
  that array.  Can remember and recall log sectors.</LI>

<LI>WriteBackList works: can add committed Transactions  and remove
  them in order; checkRead returns the appropriate write from the latest committed transaction
  (if there is one). </LI>

  <LI>ActiveTransactionList works</LI>

  <LI>Writes to log work (no writeback or recovery). Public
  ADisk interface works for a limited number of writes (then you get
  stuck because of no writeback).</LI>

  <LI>Recovery works (no writeback)</LI>

  <LI>Writeback works.</LI>

  <LI>Writeback and recovery works.</LI>

    <li>It is extremely important that you get each part of the project
      completely working before you move on to the next part. Bugs here could
      manifest in very strange behavior that will be difficult to diagnose in
      higher levels of the code. A general principle in engineering complex
      systems is &quot;go from working system to working system.&quot; That is,
      build core functionality, debug it, then add a small subset of
      functionality and test that. It is much easier to find a bug by testing a
      100-line module 20 minutes after you write it than to find the same bug by
      testing the entire 2000 line system after a week of writing code. <b><i>If
      you try to write all your code first and test it later, you are very
      likely to fail this project.</i></b> If you thoroughly test each module
      and each interface as you write it, each module may seem to take 10%
      longer, but the overall project will take much less time. It is also much
      more likely to work. Thorough testing of each phase of the project is a
      requirement of this project.<br>
</li>
    <li>Begin this part of the project by writing down your main data
      structures, and then writing pseudo-code for each of the above functions
      in terms of methods on these data structures. Given the number
      of threads and objects, think about how to structure your
      modules for safe locking that avoids deadlock. A picture may
      help you here.<br>
</li>

  <LI>You need to be able to take an object in memory, store it to
  disk as an array of bytes, and later reconstruct the object
  by reading an array of bytes from disk and converting those
  bytes to an object. Java provides a <I>serialization</I> interface
  for accomplishing this type of things. See, for example <A
  HREF="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization/">http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization/</A>. Note
  that this example writes directly to a FileOutputStream, but you may
  instead want to write to a ByteArrayOutputStream and then write the
  ByteArray to a specific offset in your file. Similarly, you may want
  to read a byte array from a specific offset of your file and then
  use that byte array via a ByteArrayInputStream.</LI>

<p>All of your implementations must adhere to (e.g., must not change) ADisk's public
interfaces specified above. Also, you may not modify the Disk interface in any way.
You may add additional public methods to ADisk; we don't think you will need to
do so (except perhaps to add testing interfaces). You can change the
interfaces to the other "internal" objects/classes. Electronically turn in (1) your well commented and elegant source code and
  (2) a file called README.</p>

<p>Your README file should include 4 sections:
<ul>
<li>
Section 1: Administrative: your names (both names 
in your 2-person team), the number of slip days that you have used
on this project and so far. Note that for a
two-person team, the number of slip days available to the team is the
<B>minimum</B> of the number of slip days available to each member of
the team.</li>

<li>
Section 2: A list of all source files in the directory with a 1-2 line
description of each</li>

<li>
Section 3: 1 short paragraph,&nbsp; describing the high-level design
of part 1. 1 short paragraph explaining the organization of locks and
threads in your architecture. 1 short paragraph explaining how
recovery works.</li>

<li>
Section 4: A discussion of your testing strategy. Outline the programs
you used (at a high level), what each one tests, and the results of
those tests. (More detailed low-level comments should be in the
programs, themselves.)</li>

The following guidelines should help
smooth the process of delivering your project. You can help us a great
deal by observing the following:
<ul>

<li>
After you finish your work, please
use the
<font color="#003300"> </font><font color="#FF0000">turnin
</font><font color="#000000">utility
to submit your work.</font></li>

<center><table WIDTH="60%" >
<tr>
<td>Usage:</td>

<td>turnin --submit <i>taid</i> cs439-labADisk <font color="#FF0000">your_files</font></td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<li>
You <font color="#FF0000">must</font> include a Makefile to compile
the program when &quot;make&quot; is typed and execute your tests when
&quot;make unit&quot; is typed.</li>

<li>Do not include class&nbsp; files in your submission!! (Or core
dumps!!!) (Or your disk data file!) (e.g., run "make clean" before turnin.)</li>



<li>
The project will be graded on the public <B>Linux</B>&nbsp;
cluster (run 'cshosts publinux' to get a list) Portability should not be a major issue if you develop on a different
platform. But, if you chose to develop on a different platform,
porting and testing on Linux by the deadline is your responsibility. The
statement &quot;it worked on my other machine&quot; will not be considered in
the grading process in any way.</li>

<li>
You are required to adhere to the multi-threaded coding standards/rules
discussed in class and described in the hand out.</li>

<li>
Code will be evaluated based on its correctness, clarity,
and elegance. Strive for simplicity. Think before you code.</li>
